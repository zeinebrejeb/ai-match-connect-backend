# --- Real Implementation Notes ---
# To implement real CV analysis:
# 1. Install a PDF parsing library (e.g., `pip install pdfminer.six`)
# 2. Read the PDF content: `content = await pdf_file.read()`
# 3. Use the library to extract text from the PDF.
# 4. Use NLP techniques (e.g., spaCy, NLTK, or a custom model) to identify sections
#    like skills, experience, education.
# 5. Parse the identified sections into the structured `ExtractedCVData` format.
# 6. This is a complex task and often requires significant fine-tuning and data.
